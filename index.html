            <h3>A journey of a web developer</h3>
            <p>I started learning how to code four years ago. When I started, I knew that I wanted to build websites and
                apps. I figured I’d learn what I needed and make some cool stuff to land an entry level developer job.
                What
                I didn’t anticipate is how many tools there were to choose from, and there wasn’t much direction on
                where to
                start. Choosing a code editor, using the command line, version control, and not to mention learning the
                tech
                jargon made it hard to start.</p>

                    efficient. I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called

                <p>They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website and
                    showed
                    it
                    to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.</p>
